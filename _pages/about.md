I am currently a PhD student at the Automatic Control Division, Department of Electrical Engineering, Link√∂ping University, working under the supervision of Assoc. Prof. Martin Enqvist. I received a B.E in Automation and Control at Hanoi University of Science and Technology, Vietnam, in 2011, and a M.S in Automatic Control at 
Politecnico di Milano, Italy in 2015.

I am working on the system modeling, identification, and fault diagnosis on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Some of the topics include:

* Linearization model of the nonlinear quadcopter.
* Closed-loop model identification.
* Sensor and system faults detection and isolation.
* Validate the methods using both simulations and experiments.
